*PrimerDriver* is a user-friendly bioinformatics platform specifically designed to generate primers for site-directed
mutagenesis experiments into workflows with an easy-to-use command-line interface. "Traversing" *PrimerDriver* lanes,
users can generate possible mutagenic primers upon input of a DNA sequence (`DNA`), design primers for an array of
species codon expression systems through direct mutation of the amino acid (`PRO`), characterize and report
user-designed primers (`CHAR`).
