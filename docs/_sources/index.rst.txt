Introduction
------------

*PrimerDriver* is a user-friendly bioinformatics platform specifically designed to generate primers for site-directed mutagenesis experiments into workflows with an easy-to-use command-line interface. “Traversing” *PrimerDriver* lanes, users can generate possible mutagenic primers upon input of a DNA sequence (``DNA``), design primers for an array of species codon expression systems through direct mutation of the amino acid (``PRO``), characterize and report user-designed primers (``CHAR``).
