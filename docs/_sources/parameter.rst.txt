Parameter Setting
*****************

The user parameter setting is possible for the inputs in PrimerDriver. The tool designs the desired mutagenic primer pairs according to user input and performs site-directed mutagenesis from single- or multiple-bases within the sequence.

The user needs to open the ``pdcli/settings.json`` file to define the range of allowable values in most of the parameters. The ``json`` file with the default settings appears as follows: ::
    
    {
        "Tm_range_min": 75,
        "Tm_range_max": 85,
        "gc_range_min": 40,
        "gc_range_max": 60,
        "length_min": 25,
        "length_max": 45,
        "flank5_range_min": 11,
        "flank5_range_max": 21,
        "flank3_range_min": 11,
        "flank3_range_max": 21,
        "forward_overlap5": 9,
        "forward_overlap3": 9,
        "terminate_gc" : 1,
        "center_mutation": 0,
        "primer_mode": "overlapping",
        "expression_system": "Homo sapiens"
    }

The following definitions and considerations should be made for designing mutagenic primers:

- ``Tm_range``
    This is where the user sets the minimum and maximum allowable melting temperature (:math:`T_m`) of primers in a PCR reaction. Depending on the type of mutation, the melting temperature is calculated differently. Estimation of the Tm of primers for base substitution is defined by

    .. math::

        T_m = 81.5 + 0.41(\%\textrm{GC}) - \frac{675}{N} - \%\textrm{mismatch}

    where :math:`N` is the primer length in base pairs, and :math:`\%\textrm{GC}, \%\textrm{mismatch}` are whole numbers. A modified formula is used for calculating :math:`T_m` that intends to introduce deletions or insertions:

    .. math::

        T_m = 81.5 + 0.41(\%\textrm{GC}) - \frac{675}{N}

- ``gc_range``
    The GC content is calculated as
    
    .. math::

        \%\textrm{GC} = \frac{\textrm{# of G + # of C}}{\textrm{total length of primer}}

    and the range of GC in a primer is to be set by the user. The user can follow the percentage as prescribed by a protocol or the user can just set the range from 0 to 100.

- ``length``
    The total length of the desired mutagenic primer

- ``flank5_range``
    This is the length of the region that is to the left of the mutation when read in standard sequence notation.

- ``flank3_range``
    This refers to the length of the region that is to the right of the mutation when read in 5’ to 3’.

- ``forward_overlap5``
    When generating overlapping primers, this is where the user sets the minimum number of overlapping bases of the 5’ end of the forward primer to the reverse primer.

- ``forward_overlap3``
    This sets the minimum number of base overlaps from the 3’ end of the forward primer to the reverse primer.

- ``terminate_gc``
    Set in boolean values, this refers to having a GC clamp at both ends of the primers.

- ``center_mutation``
    This sets the mutation is centered within the primer. Flanking regions differ by at most one base pair. These are set by boolean values.

- ``primer_mode``
    This gives the user the choice of having overlapping primers or complementary primers. Both modes use protocol from QuikChange™ Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit by Stratagene®.

    - Complementary
        The values for the flanking regions will just be applied to the forward primer. The reverse primers will just be the reverse complements of the forward primers.
    
    - Overlapping
        Both the forward and reverse primers will be screened for the flanking region values. Forward overlap values will also be applied when generating the primer pairs.

- ``expression_system``
    When using Protein based primer design, the user can choose from a number of commonly used model organisms used in molecular and cell biology. This enables the tool to generate primers that use the optimum codon for the chosen organism.
